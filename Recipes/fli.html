    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
         <strong>Albanian fli</strong> is a traditional dish commonly prepared in the northern regions of Albania,
         known for its layers of thin, crepe-like dough and savory filling. The recipe begins with making 
         the dough, which is typically a simple mixture of flour, water, and a pinch of salt, kneaded into
         a smooth consistency. The dough is then rolled into thin sheets and cooked one by one in a large,
         shallow pan. Once a layer of dough is cooked, it's brushed with melted butter and stacked with 
        additional layers. This process continues, and the fli is cooked until golden brown on both sides.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dish is usually served as a main course or a side dish, often accompanied by yogurt or a salad.
        Some variations of fli may include fillings such as cheese or minced meat, but the classic version is 
        made with just dough and butter, resulting in a rich, soft texture. Fli holds great cultural 
        significance in Albanian cuisine, especially during festive occasions and family gatherings, as it symbolizes 
        hospitality and tradition.

        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, a pinch of salt, and water to form a smooth dough. 
            The consistency should be similar to pizza dough but slightly softer.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Divide the Dough:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Divide the dough into small portions, depending on how many layers you want to make.</li></ul>
        </li>
    <li><strong>Roll the Dough:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Take each portion of dough and roll it into a thin sheet, as thin as possible (similar to crepes).</li>
            <li>You can use a rolling pin or stretch it by hand if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Layers:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat a large, shallow frying pan (preferably non-stick) over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place one layer of the dough into the pan and cook it for about 1-2 minutes, until the bottom is lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Brush the cooked side with melted butter.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Stack the Layers:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Place another layer of dough on top of the first, cooking and buttering it just like the previous one.</li>
            <li>Continue stacking layers and buttering each one. You can make as many layers as you like, but typically, fli is made with 6-8 layers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Final Layer:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Once all layers are stacked, cook the final layer for 2-3 minutes until itâ€™s golden brown on both sides.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Remove the fli from the pan and let it cool slightly before slicing it into wedges.</li>
        <li>Serve with yogurt or a salad on the side for a traditional touch.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
