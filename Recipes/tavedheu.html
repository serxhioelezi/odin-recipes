<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Tave Dheu</strong> is a traditional <strong>Albanian</strong> dish, typically made with lamb, beef, or sometimes chicken or pork. The meat is marinated in a mix of olive oil, garlic, onions, and spices like paprika and bay leaves, creating a rich, flavorful base. It is then slow-cooked with vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, often in a clay pot, which enhances the dish's taste.
</p>

<p>This hearty meal is usually served with crusty bread to soak up the savory sauce and can be paired with yogurt or a fresh salad. Tave Dheu is a symbol of Albanian hospitality, offering a comforting, flavorful experience perfect for family gatherings and special occasions.</p>
