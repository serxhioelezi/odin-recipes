<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Tave Kosi</strong> is a classic <strong>Albanian</strong> dish made with lamb or chicken, baked in a creamy yogurt sauce, and seasoned with spices. The name "Tave Kosi" translates to "baked yogurt dish," highlighting the key ingredient—yogurt—used to create a rich, tangy base for the dish. The meat is usually first browned in a pan, then placed in a baking dish with a mixture of yogurt, eggs, and a bit of flour to thicken the sauce. The dish is then baked until golden and bubbling.
</p>

    The combination of tender meat and creamy yogurt gives Tave Kosi its signature comforting texture and flavor. It’s often served with rice or bread, making it a hearty and satisfying meal. This dish is a beloved part of Albanian cuisine, typically enjoyed during family gatherings or special occasions. The creamy yogurt sauce adds a unique balance to the savory meat, making it a true Albanian favorite.
